                <br>
                <p>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
                <li>Anything in the tech world honestly. I love everything that involves tech and just want to be apart of it. I'm looking forward to the end of this course when i'll get help to find a a job with Devacademy, or I could maybe get one with my fathers company.</li>
                <br>
                <p>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</p>
                <li>One of my strengths is that I learn quickly, especially when interested, and Iâ€™m good at simplifying complex ideas. I'm self-motivated and enjoy exploring new topics. One of my limitations is I sometimes lose focus on less engaging subjects and can overthink, which slows me down. Tight deadlines are also challenging.</li>
                <br>
                <p>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
                <li>I hope to improve my communication skills developed futher during my time with Devacademy. I think this is one place where improvement is needed for me.</li>
                <br>
                <p>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme?</p>
                <li>To manage me time, I have 2 - 2 hour blocks where my sole focus is course work. This will encourage me to be focused on completing work. When things are starting to build up and I don't think I can handle it, I will reach out via Discord direct messages to explain my current situation.</li>
                <br>
                <p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</p>
                <li>Whenever I am struggling with something I know I can always send a message in the discord channel asking for support in whatever it is I am doing. Though, I will only be asking for help if I'm stuck on something for an extended amount of time.</li>
                <br>
                <p>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</p>
                <li>Only things I expect from facilitation team are to just to help me through this course and be nice I guess. </li>
                <br>
                <p>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</p>
                <li>I do currently work a 10-6 job so I'm trying to build my course work time around this fact. Sometimes things do pop up out of nowhere sometimes, but I think 1 or 2 days a week I miss of course work will not set me behind far.</li>
