                <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>

                <p>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</p>
                <li>I found a teammate plagiarizing during a group project, We confronted them privately, offering a chance to fix it instead of reporting them.This balanced integrity with compassion, and I believe it was the right choice.</li>
                <p>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</p>
                <li>The culture and people in my life have influenced my life a lot. My mum's side being Samoan I think influenced why I think family is so important to me and also why I think being humorous is important. My dads side of the family definitely taught me to be honest and the importance of humility.</li>
                <p>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</p>
                <li>My first strength is humility, I think this will make me open to feedback and make me be able to accept my mistakes. Second strength is judgment. This strength will support me by making me evaluate information, make informed decisions and reflect on my learning My third strength is honesty. I think this strength will help me by owning my mistakes and being able to self-assess myself accurately.</li>
                <p>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</p>
                <li>I think that teamwork is something that might limit my development. I have never really been able to rely on others when something needs to be done, so usually I just do everything myself. Another thing would be procrastination. Unless I'm really interested in something I tend to leave everything till the last second.</li>
                <p>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</p>
                <li>When I was in high school, my friends werenâ€™t working and were just talking instead of doing work. I removed myself from the area and sat by myself to continue my work. It was effective. I used to do it all the time. I would do it again because I think it works well.</li>
